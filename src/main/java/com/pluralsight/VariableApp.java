// then code solution

// then use System.out.println() to display results
// ex: System.out.println("The answer is " + answer);
        //Step 2
        //1. Declare AND initialize variables for:
        //2. The number of days in a week
        //3. The price of coffee ($4.99)
        //4. Your favorite letter
        //5. Whether it's raining (true/false)
        //6. Print all values in complete sentences
